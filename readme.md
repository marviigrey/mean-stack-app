This application contains four combination of the following component:

1. MongoDB: is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is used to store the data required by the MEAN stack app, such as user information, posts, comments, and other relevant data.


2. Express: Express.js is a powerful web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications, such as routing, middleware, and templating. It is used to create the server-side of the MEAN stack app, which handles requests from the client-side and interacts with the database.

3. Angular: Angular is a powerful front-end JavaScript framework that is used to build dynamic and interactive web applications. It is used to create the client-side of the MEAN stack app, which communicates with the server-side.

4. Node.js: Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side of the MEAN stack app. It is used to build fast and efficient server-side code that handles requests from the client-side and interacts with the database.

5. The user interacts with the front-end of the application built using Angular. This includes the user interface, such as forms, buttons, and views.

6. Communication:
The client-side communicates with the server-side using RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to perform various actions, such as retrieving data from the database, updating data, and deleting data. The server-side processes the requests and sends a response back to the client-side.

7. Server-Side (Node.js and Express.js):
The server-side of the MEAN stack app is built using Node.js and Express.js. When a user interacts with the client-side, Angular sends requests to the server-side to perform various actions, such as retrieving data from the database, updating data, and deleting data.
